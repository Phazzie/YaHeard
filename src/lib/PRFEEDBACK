Summary of Changes
Hello @Phazzie, I'm Gemini Code Assist1! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!

This pull request delivers a foundational transformation of the YaHeard application, evolving it from a demo reliant on static data to a fully functional, enterprise-grade multi-AI transcription consensus system. The changes enable real audio processing through diverse AI services, intelligently synthesizing their outputs to provide highly accurate and transparent transcription results.

Highlights
Real AI Integration: The system now integrates 5 enterprise-grade AI services (OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Google Gemini) for real-time audio transcription, replacing previous mock data.
Sophisticated Consensus Engine: A new mathematical algorithm (70% confidence + 30% text similarity) has been implemented to analyze and select the most accurate transcription from multiple AI outputs, including pairwise similarity analysis and service performance scoring.
Enhanced Architecture & Code Quality: Significant improvements include a contract-driven design with pluggable AI services, centralized configuration, shared UI utilities, comprehensive validation, and robust error handling for graceful degradation.
Critical System Bug Fixed: The core API endpoint (src/routes/api/transcribe/+server.ts) has been completely rewritten to call real AI processors and the consensus engine, resolving a critical bug where it was previously returning hardcoded fake data.

Hey there - I've reviewed your changes - here's some feedback:

The compareTranscriptions method is extremely large—consider breaking it into smaller, focused helper functions or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
There are many raw console.log/console.warn calls—swap these out for a structured logger or configurable log levels to prevent noisy output in production.
The AI processor initialization in your API handler is repetitive—extract it into a shared factory or helper to centralize environment‐variable checks and simplify the route code.

Duplicate disagreement removal logic may miss some edge cases.

Consider normalizing service pairs and rounding severity values to a fixed precision before comparison to improve duplicate detection.

</code_context>

<issue_to_address>
Truncation logic may break JSON structure.

Truncating at a character limit can produce invalid JSON. Instead, truncate at a structural boundary or offer a summarized view to maintain valid output.

Suggested implementation:

```typescript
/**
 * Safely stringify JSON data with size limits.
 * Truncates objects/arrays at a property/item limit to preserve valid JSON.
 */
export function formatJsonSafely(data: unknown): string {
  const MAX_ITEMS = UI_CONFIG.MAX_JSON_DISPLAY_ITEMS ?? 50; // fallback if not set
  let wasTruncated = false;

  function truncate(obj: any, depth = 0): any {
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
      if (obj.length > MAX_ITEMS) {
        wasTruncated = true;
        return obj.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS).concat(['...(truncated)']);
      }
      return obj.map(item => truncate(item, depth + 1));
    } else if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') {
      const keys = Object.keys(obj);
      if (keys.length > MAX_ITEMS) {
        wasTruncated = true;
        const truncatedObj: any = {};
        for (const key of keys.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS)) {
          truncatedObj[key] = truncate(obj[key], depth + 1);
        }
        truncatedObj['...(truncated)'] = true;
        return truncatedObj;
      }
      const result: any = {};
      for (const key of keys) {
        result[key] = truncate(obj[key], depth + 1);
      }
      return result;
    }
    return obj;
  }

  try {
    const safeData = truncate(data);
    let jsonString = JSON.stringify(safeData, null, 2);
    if (wasTruncated) {
      jsonString += '\n/* Output truncated for display */';
    }
    return jsonString;

```

- You may want to add `MAX_JSON_DISPLAY_ITEMS` to your `UI_CONFIG` if it does not exist, or adjust the fallback value.
- This approach preserves valid JSON structure and clearly indicates truncation.
- If you want to support deeper truncation (e.g., limit depth), you can add a `MAX_DEPTH` parameter to the `truncate` function.

<issue_to_address>
AVOID threshold is set equal to ACCEPTABLE, which may cause ambiguity.

Consider setting AVOID to a value below ACCEPTABLE to prevent overlap and ensure clear classification boundaries.

<issue_to_address>
Using btoa for base64 encoding may fail for large or non-ASCII files.

btoa is limited to ASCII strings and may not handle binary audio data correctly. Use Buffer (Node.js) or a dedicated base64 library for reliable encoding.

suggestion (bug_risk): Truncation logic may break JSON structure.

Truncating at a character limit can produce invalid JSON. Instead, truncate at a structural boundary or offer a summarized view to maintain valid output.

Suggested implementation:

/**
 * Safely stringify JSON data with size limits.
 * Truncates objects/arrays at a property/item limit to preserve valid JSON.
 */
export function formatJsonSafely(data: unknown): string {
  const MAX_ITEMS = UI_CONFIG.MAX_JSON_DISPLAY_ITEMS ?? 50; // fallback if not set
  let wasTruncated = false;

  function truncate(obj: any, depth = 0): any {
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
      if (obj.length > MAX_ITEMS) {
        wasTruncated = true;
        return obj.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS).concat(['...(truncated)']);
      }
      return obj.map(item => truncate(item, depth + 1));
    } else if (obj && typeof obj === 'object') {
      const keys = Object.keys(obj);
      if (keys.length > MAX_ITEMS) {
        wasTruncated = true;
        const truncatedObj: any = {};
        for (const key of keys.slice(0, MAX_ITEMS)) {
          truncatedObj[key] = truncate(obj[key], depth + 1);
        }
        truncatedObj['...(truncated)'] = true;
        return truncatedObj;
      }
      const result: any = {};
      for (const key of keys) {
        result[key] = truncate(obj[key], depth + 1);
      }
      return result;
    }
    return obj;
  }

  try {
    const safeData = truncate(data);
    let jsonString = JSON.stringify(safeData, null, 2);
    if (wasTruncated) {
      jsonString += '\n/* Output truncated for display */';
    }
    return jsonString;
You may want to add MAX_JSON_DISPLAY_ITEMS to your UI_CONFIG if it does not exist, or adjust the fallback value.
This approach preserves valid JSON structure and clearly indicates truncation.
If you want to support deeper truncation (e.g., limit depth), you can add a MAX_DEPTH parameter to the truncate function.

Consider setting AVOID to a value below ACCEPTABLE to prevent overlap and ensure clear classification boundaries.

@sourcery-ai sourcery-ai bot 24 minutes ago
issue (bug_risk): Using btoa for base64 encoding may fail for large or non-ASCII files.

btoa is limited to ASCII strings and may not handle binary audio data correctly. Use Buffer (Node.js) or a dedicated base64 library for reliable encoding.

Code Review
This pull request is a massive and impressive transformation, successfully replacing mock data with a sophisticated, fault-tolerant, multi-AI consensus engine. The architecture is robust, with excellent separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation, and great error handling. The new consensus algorithm is well-thought-out and a huge improvement over the placeholder. I've identified a few issues, including a critical one in a Svelte component that will break the build, and some high-severity inconsistencies in API responses and service usage that could cause runtime failures. Once these are addressed, this will be an outstanding contribution.

critical

Using export const for a Svelte component prop is invalid syntax and will cause a compilation error. Props must be declared with export let. If height is not intended to be a prop passed from a parent component, it should be a regular const without the export keyword. Given the comment // For external reference only, it seems the intention might be to share this constant. The best practice for that would be to define it in a shared configuration file (like src/lib/config.ts) and import it where needed.

The structure of the JSON response has been changed from { success, allResults, consensus } to { success, result }. The PR description states that the response structure should be maintained for frontend compatibility. This change is likely to break the client-side code that consumes this endpoint. To avoid breaking the frontend, please consider reverting to a structure that is backward-compatible, for example by returning both consensus and allResults properties. Note that the fallback logic in the catch block starting on line 156 should also be updated to return the same compatible structure.

### 🚨 **CRITICAL FINDING**
**API ENDPOINT USING MOCK DATA:** Discovered that while individual AI implementations (Whisper, AssemblyAI, Deepgram) are fully functional with real API integrations, the main API endpoint `/src/routes/api/transcribe/+server.ts` is using hardcoded mock results instead of calling these real implementations.

**IMPACT:** Users currently receive fake transcription results instead of actual AI processing.

**STATUS:** 
- ✅ **Real AI Implementations Verified:** All three AI services have working API integrations

For server-to-server, adopt OAuth 2.0 or service-account/Workload Identity Federation.
For direct client use, issue ephemeral tokens.
If you must use an API key, load it from an environment variable on your server and send it in an HTTP header (e.g. x-goog-api-key).

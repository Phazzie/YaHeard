/**
 * =============================================================================
 * @file +page.server.ts - BLOB UPLOAD ACTION HANDLER
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
 * =====================
 * This server-side code handles the initial step of the transcription process:
 * securely uploading the user's audio file to Vercel Blob storage. It does NOT
 * perform any AI processing itself.
 *
 * @phazzie-status working
 * @last-regenerated 2025-08-30 18:04 UTC
 * @dependencies @vercel/blob
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
 * ===================
 * 1. FORM HANDLING: Receives the file from the user's form submission.
 * 2. SECURE URL GENERATION: Creates a time-limited, signed URL for the client
 *    to upload the file directly to Vercel Blob.
 * 3. DECOUPLING: Separates the file upload step from the long-running
 *    transcription step, which is handled by a background function.
 *
 * This approach solves two critical Vercel deployment issues:
 * 1. PAYLOAD SIZE LIMIT: The user's file does not need to pass through this
 *    serverless function, bypassing the 4.5MB payload limit.
 * 2. FUNCTION TIMEOUT: This function returns a response almost instantly,
 *    preventing the 10-15s timeout.

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * CONTRACT COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This server implementation guarantees:
 * ✅ SvelteKit Actions compliance - proper form handling
 * ✅ Multi-AI orchestration - parallel processing of all services
 * ✅ Consensus algorithm integration - intelligent result combination
 * ✅ Comprehensive error handling - graceful failure with guidance
 * ✅ Security-first approach - server-side API key management
 * ✅ Performance optimization - parallel processing and early validation
 *
 * REGENERATION CHECKLIST:
 * =======================
 * When regenerating this file, ensure:
 * 1. Actions interface is still implemented correctly
 * 2. All AI services are properly initialized and called
 * 3. Consensus algorithm provides meaningful results
 * 4. Error messages guide regeneration efforts
 * 5. Security practices are maintained
 * 6. Performance optimizations are preserved
